    <h2>HackSI Inc.</h2>
    
    <p>In December of 2016 we formed HackSI Inc. as a not for profit to aide in funding
    our annual event. This allows us to have a greater potential for corporate sponsorships to help
    us provide more fantastic events.</p>

    <p>We are also planning ways in which we can help spread technology throughout Southern Illinois
    on a regular basis once the funding for the event is met. We will have more information on this
    as the planning progresses.</p>

    <h2>Our Board</h2>

    <p>Our small board is represented by several people in the community that truly care about HackSI
    and what it means for Southern Illinois.</p>
