    <h1>Sponsoring HackSI</h1>
    
    <p>HackSI depends completely on donations from our corporate sponsors as well as individual donations from people
    like you! Every little bit helps us to provide a fantastic event for our hackers. Even a donation as small as $5.00 
    could add hardware or food for the hackers.</p>

    <p>As of December 2016, HackSI, Inc is a registered not for profit in the state of Illinois. We are currently
    working to file our Federal 501(c)3 paperwork to obtian federal not for profit status.</p>

<p>We have sponsorship tiers available. If you want to be part of this awesome hackathon, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:sponsors@hacksi.org">sponsors@hacksi.org</a>. Our sponsorship levels can be <a href="/sponsors/levels">found here</a>.</p>
